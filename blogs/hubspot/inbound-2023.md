## It's time for INBOUND, the premier conference that brings together business, marketing, and sales leaders to network, learn, and grow. This year, HubSpot is excited to bring an all-star lineup of industry-spanning icons, marketing and sales leaders, wellness experts, and acclaimed authors to INBOUNDâ€™s biggest stage. 
One of the most important - and popular - parts of INBOUND are the Spotlight sessions from HubSpot, highlighting product announcements and the future state of the company, and the industry on the whole. This year, Andy Pitre, HubSpot's EVP of Product, announced some incredible product updates and we asked members of our Product & Engineering community to weigh in. Hear what they had to say below!
